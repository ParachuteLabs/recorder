## 🔄 Changes by Phase

### Phase 1: Critical Code Quality Fixes

**Problem**: 52 analyzer errors, dead code, memory leaks, no linting

**Solution**:
- Deleted 5 broken/dead files causing 100+ errors
  - `voice_note_provider_broken.dart`, `voice_note_provider_old.dart`
  - `speech_service_old.dart`, `transcription_service.dart`
  - `sample_data.dart`
- Fixed PlaybackControls dispose memory leak (removed setState in dispose)
- Added comprehensive linting configuration with 30+ rules
- Created technical debt audit document

**Files Changed**: 10 files, -1322 insertions

---

### Phase 2: State Management Migration

**Problem**: Singleton anti-pattern, tight coupling, untestable services

**Solution**:
- Added `flutter_riverpod ^2.6.1` and code generation tools
- Created `lib/providers/service_providers.dart` with 3 providers:
  - `audioServiceProvider` - Auto-initialized with disposal
  - `storageServiceProvider` - Auto-initialized
  - `whisperServiceProvider` - Dependency-aware
- Converted 6 screens to `ConsumerStatefulWidget`:
  - HomeScreen, RecordingScreen, PostRecordingScreen
  - RecordingDetailScreen, SettingsScreen, PlaybackControls
- Replaced 22+ direct service instantiations with `ref.read()`
- Wrapped app with `ProviderScope`

**Files Changed**: 13 files, +484/-111 lines

**Benefits**:
- Testable architecture (services can be mocked)
- Proper dependency injection
- Automatic lifecycle management
- No singleton anti-pattern

---

### Phase 3: Code Quality Improvements

**Problem**: 100+ print statements, deprecated APIs, unsafe async code

**Solution**:

**1. Logging** (100+ changes)
- Replaced all `print()` with `debugPrint()`
- Added `flutter/foundation.dart` imports
- Production-safe logging (can be disabled in release)

**2. Deprecated API Fixes** (9 occurrences)
- `withOpacity()` → `withValues(alpha:)`
- Fixed in PostRecordingScreen, RecordingDetailScreen, SettingsScreen

**3. Async Safety** (6+ fixes)
- Fixed BuildContext usage across async gaps
- Cached Navigator/ScaffoldMessenger before async operations
- Added proper `mounted` checks

**4. Input Validation** (NEW)
- Created `Validators` utility class
- Title validation (max length, non-empty)
- API key format validation (OpenAI keys)
- Tag validation (character restrictions)
- Added assertions to Recording model
- Null-safe JSON parsing

**5. Cleanup**
- Removed unused imports (5+ files)
- Fixed unused catch variables
- Removed deprecated lint rules

**Files Changed**: 10 files, +200/-117 lines

---

### Phase 4: Architecture & Testing

**Problem**: No separation of concerns, no tests, no error handling

**Solution**:

**1. Repository Pattern** (NEW)
- Created `RecordingRepository` for data access abstraction
- Clean CRUD API separating business logic from data access
- Added Riverpod provider for DI
- Follows SOLID principles

**2. Error Boundaries** (NEW)
- Global `FlutterError.onError` handler
- `PlatformDispatcher.onError` for uncaught errors
- Production-ready logging
- Prepared for crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry)

**3. Test Foundation** (27 tests ✅)
- `test/models/recording_test.dart` - 13 tests
  - JSON serialization/deserialization
  - Validation assertions
  - Formatting utilities
  - Edge cases
- `test/utils/validators_test.dart` - 11 tests
  - All validation functions
  - Input sanitization
  - Path validation
- `test/repositories/recording_repository_test.dart` - 3 tests
  - Repository initialization
  - API surface verification

**Files Changed**: 6 files, +366 insertions
